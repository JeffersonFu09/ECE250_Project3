Created a Trie data structure to implement a spellchecker. 
The Trie supports:
- Loading a base dictionary of words
- Inserting new words
- Count number of words that have a given prefix
- Erase a word in the Trie
- Print all words in the Trie
- Offer word suggestions when words are not spelled correctly
- Clear all words in Trie
